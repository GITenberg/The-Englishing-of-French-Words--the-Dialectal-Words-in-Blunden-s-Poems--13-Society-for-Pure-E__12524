<h2>
    FRENCH WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
</h2>
<h3>
    I
</h3>
<p>
    The English language is an Inn of Strange Meetings where all sorts and
    conditions of words are assembled. Some are of the bluest blood and of
    authentic royal descent; and some are children of the gutter not wise
    enough to know their own fathers. Some are natives whose ancestors were
    rooted in the soil since a day whereof the memory of man runneth not to
    the contrary; and some are strangers of outlandish origin, coming to us
    from all the shores of all the Seven Seas either to tarry awhile and
    then to depart for ever, unwelcome sojourners only, or to settle down
    at last and found a family soon asserting equality with the oldest
    inhabitants of the vocabulary. Seafaring terms came to us from
    Scandinavia and from the Low Countries. Words of warfare on land crossed
    the channel, in exchange for words of warfare at sea which migrated from
    England to France. Dead tongues, Greek and Latin, have been revived to
    replenish our verbal population with the terms needed for the sciences;
    and Italy has sent us a host of words by the fine arts.
</p>
<p>
    The stream of immigrants from the French language has been for almost a
    thousand years larger than that from any other tongue; and even to-day
    it shows little sign of lessening. Of all the strangers within our gates
    none are more warmly received than those which come to us from across
    the Straits of Dover. None are more swiftly able to make themselves
    at home in our dictionaries and to pass themselves off as English.
    At least, this was the case until comparatively recently, when the
    process of adoption and assimilation became a little slower and more
    than a little less satisfactory. Of late French words, even those long
    domiciled in our lexicons, have been treated almost as if they were
    still aliens, as if they were here on sufferance, so to speak, as if
    they had not become members of the commonwealth. They were allowed to
    work, no doubt, and sometimes even to be overworked; but they laboured
    as foreigners, perhaps even more eagerly employed by the snobbish
    because they were foreigners and yet held in disrepute by the more
    fastidious because they were not truly English. That is to say, French
    words are still as hospitably greeted as ever before, but they are now
    often ranked as guests only and not as members of the household.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps this may seem to some a too fanciful presentation of the case.
    Perhaps it would be simpler to say that until comparatively recently a
    foreign word taken over into English was made over into an English word,
    whereas in the past two or three centuries there has been an evident
    tendency to keep it French and to use it freely while retaining its
    French pronunciation, its French accents, its French spelling, and its
    French plural. This tendency is contrary to the former habits of our
    language. It is dangerous to the purity of English. It forces itself
    on our attention and it demands serious consideration.
</p>
<h3>
    II
</h3>
<p>
    In his brief critical biography of Rutebeuf, M. Clédat pointed out that
    for long years the only important literature in Europe was the French,
    and that the French language had on three several occasions almost
    established itself as the language of European civilization&mdash;once in the
    thirteenth century, again in the seventeenth, and finally when Napoleon
    had made himself temporarily master of the Continent. The earlier
    universities of Europe were modelled on that of Paris, where Dante had
    gone to study. Frederick the Great despised his native tongue, spoke it
    imperfectly, and wrote his unnecessary verses in French. Even now French
    is only at last losing its status as the accredited tongue of diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
    The French made their language in their own image; and it is therefore
    logical, orderly, and clear. Sainte-Beuve declared that a 'philosophical
    thought has probably not attained all its sharpness and all its
    illumination until it is expressed in French'. As the French are noted
    rather for their intelligence than for their imagination, they are the
    acknowledged masters of prose; and their achievement in poetry is more
    disputable. As they are governed by the social instinct, their language
    exhibits the varied refinements of a cultivated society where
    conversation is held in honour as one of the arts. The English speech,
    like the English-speaking peoples, is bolder, more energetic, more
    suggestive, and perhaps less precise. From no language could English
    borrow with more profit to itself than from French; and from no language
    has it borrowed more abundantly and more persistently. Many of the
    English words which we can trace to Latin and through Latin to Greek,
    came to us, not direct from Rome and Athens, but indirectly from Paris.
    And native French words attain international acceptance almost as easily
    as do scientific compounds from Greek and Latin. <i>Phonograph</i> and
    <i>telephone</i> were not more swiftly taken up than <i>chassis</i> and <i>garage</i>.
</p>
<p>
    But <i>chassis</i> and <i>garage</i> still retain their French pronunciation, or
    perhaps it would be better to say they still receive a pronunciation
    which is as close an approximation to that of the French as our
    unpractised tongues can compass. And in thus taking over these French
    words while striving to preserve their Frenchiness, we are neglectful
    of our duty, we are imperilling the purity of our own language, and we
    are deserting the wholesome tradition of English&mdash;the tradition which
    empowered us to take at our convenience but to refashion what we had
    taken to suit our own linguistic habits.
</p>
<p>
    'Speaking in general terms,' Mr. Pearsall Smith writes, in his outline
    history of the English language, 'we may say that down to about 1650 the
    French words that were borrowed were thoroughly naturalized in English,
    and were made sooner or later to conform to the rules of English
    pronunciation and accent; while in the later borrowings (unless they
    have become very popular) an attempt is made to pronounce them in the
    French fashion.' From Mr. Smith's pages it would be easy to select
    examples of the complete assimilation which was attained centuries ago.
    <i>Caitiff, canker</i>, and <i>carrion</i> came to us from the Norman dialect of
    French; and from their present appearance no one but a linguistic expert
    would suspect their exotic ancestry, <i>Jury, larceny, lease, embezzle,
    distress,</i> and <i>improve</i> have descended from the jargon of the lawyers
    who went on thinking in French after they were supposed to be speaking
    and writing in English. Of equal historical significance are the two
    series of words which English acquired from the military vocabulary
    of the French,&mdash;the first containing <i>company, regiment, battalion,
    brigade, division</i>, and <i>army</i>; and the second consisting of <i>marshal,
    general, colonel, major, captain, lieutenant, sergeant</i>, and <i>corporal</i>.
</p>
<p>
    (Here I claim the privilege of a parenthesis to remark that in Great
    Britain <i>lieutenant</i> is generally pronounced <i>leftenant</i>, than which no
    anglicization could be more complete, whereas in the United States this
    officer is called the <i>lootenant</i>, which the privates of the American
    Expeditionary Force in France habitually shortened to '<i>loot</i>'&mdash;except,
    of course, when they were actually addressing this superior. It may be
    useful to note, moreover, that while 'colonel' has chosen the spelling
    of one French form, it has acquired the pronunciation of another.)
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Henry Bradley in the <i>Making of English</i> provides further evidence
    of the aforetime primacy of the French in the military art. '<i>War</i>
    itself is a Norman-French word, and among the other French words
    belonging to the same department which became English before the end of
    the thirteenth century' are <i>armour, assault, banner, battle, fortress,
    lance, siege, standard</i>, and <i>tower</i>&mdash;all of them made citizens of our
    vocabulary, after having renounced their allegiance to their native
    land. Another quotation from Dr. Bradley imposes itself. He tells us
    that the English writers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries felt
    themselves at liberty to introduce a French word whenever they pleased.
    'The innumerable words brought into the language in this way are
    naturally of the most varied character with regard to meaning. Many of
    them, which supplied no permanent need of the language, have long been
    obsolete.'
</p>
<p>
    This second sentence may well give us heart of hope considering the
    horde of French terms which invaded our tongue in the long years of the
    Great War. If <i>camion</i> and <i>avion, vrille</i> and <i>escadrille</i> supply no
    permanent need of the language they may soon become obsolete, just as
    <i>mitrailleuse</i> and <i>franc-tireur</i> slipped out of sight soon after the
    end of the Franco-Prussian war of fifty years ago. A French modification
    of the American 'gatling' was by them called a <i>mitrailleuse</i>;
    and nowadays we have settled down to the use of <i>machine-gun</i>.
    A <i>franc-tireur</i> was an irregular volunteer often incompletely
    uniformed; and when he was captured the Prussians shot him as a
    guerrilla. It will be a welcome relief if <i>camouflage</i>, as popular five
    years ago as <i>fin-de-siècle</i> twenty-five years ago, shall follow that
    now unfashionable vocable into what an American president once described
    as 'innocuous desuetude'. Perhaps we may liken <i>mitrailleuse</i> and
    <i>franc-tireur, vrille</i> and <i>escadrille, brisance</i> and <i>rafale</i>, to the
    foreign labourers who cross the frontier to aid in the harvest and who
    return to their own country when the demand for their service is over.
</p>
<h3>
    III
</h3>
<p>
    The principle which ought to govern can be stated simply. English
    should be at liberty to help itself freely to every foreign word which
    seems to fill a want in our own language. It ought to take these words
    on probation, so to speak, keeping those which prove themselves useful,
    and casting out those which are idle or rebellious. And then those which
    are retained ought to become completely English, in pronunciation, in
    accent, in spelling, and in the formation of their plurals. No doubt
    this is to-day a counsel of perfection; but it indicates the goal which
    should be strived for. It is what English was capable of accomplishing
    prior to the middle of the seventeenth century. It is what English may
    be able to accomplish in the middle of the twentieth century, if we once
    awaken to the danger of contaminating our speech with unassimilated
    words, and to the disgrace, which our stupidity or laziness must bring
    upon us, of addressing the world in a pudding-stone and piebald
    language. Dr. Bradley has warned us that 'the pedantry that would bid
    us reject the word fittest for our purpose because it is not of native
    origin ought to be strenuously resisted'; and I am sure that he would
    advocate an equally strenuous resistance to the pedantry which would
    impose upon us words of alien tongue still clad in foreign uniform.
</p>
<p>
    Mark Twain once remarked that 'everybody talks about the weather and
    nobody does anything about it'. And many people think that we might as
    well hope to direct the course of the winds as to order the evolution
    of our speech. Some words have proved intractable. In the course of the
    past two centuries and a half, scores and even hundreds of French words
    have domiciled themselves in English without relinquishing their French
    characteristics. Consider the sad case of <i>élite</i> (which Byron used a
    hundred years ago), of <i>encore</i> (which Steele used two hundred years
    ago) of <i>parvenu</i> (which Gifford used in 1802), of <i>ennui</i> (which
    Evelyn used in 1667), and of <i>nuance</i> (which Walpole used in 1781).
</p>
<p>
    No one hesitates to accept these words and to employ them frequently.
    <i>Ennui</i> and <i>nuance</i> are two words which cannot well be spared, but
    which we are unable to reproduce in our native vocalization. Their
    French pronunciation is out of the question. What can be done? Can
    anything be done? We may at least look the facts in the face and govern
    our own individual conduct by the results of this scrutiny. There is no
    reason why we should not accept what is a fact; and it is a fact that
    <i>ennui</i> has been adopted. So long ago as 1805 Sidney Smith used it as a
    verb and said that he had been <i>ennuied</i>. Why not therefore frankly and
    boldly pronounce it as English&mdash;<i>ennwee</i>? Why not forswear French again
    and pronounce <i>nuance</i> without trying vainly to preserve the Gallic
    nasality of the second n&mdash;<i>newance</i>? And as for a third necessary word,
    <i>timbre</i>. I can only register here my complete concurrence with the
    opinion expressed in Tract No. 3 of the Society for Pure English&mdash;that
    the 'English form of the French sound of the word would be approximately
    <i>tamber</i>; and this would be not only a good English-sounding word, like
    <i>amber</i> and <i>chamber</i>, but would be like our <i>tambour</i>, which is
    <i>tympanum</i>, which again is <i>timbre</i>'.
</p>
<p>
    Why should not <i>séance</i> (which was used by Charles Lamb in 1803)
    drop its French accent and take an English pronunciation&mdash;<i>see-ance</i>?
    Why should not <i>garage</i> and <i>barrage</i> rhyme easily with <i>marriage</i>?
    <i>Marriage</i> itself came to us from the French; and it sets a good example
    to these two latest importations. Logic would suggest this, of course;
    but then logic does not always guide our linguistic practices. And here,
    again, I am glad to accept another suggestion which I find in Tract No.
    3, that <i>naivety</i> be recognized and pronounced as an English word, and
    that 'a useful word like <i>malaise</i> could with advantage reassume the
    old form "malease" which it once possessed'.
</p>
<p>
    I have asked why these thoroughly acclimated French words should not
    be made to wear our English livery; and to this question Dr. Bradley
    supplied an answer when he declared that 'culture is one of the
    influences which retard the process of simplification'. A man of culture
    is likely to be familiar with one or more foreign languages; and perhaps
    he may be a little vain of his intimacy with them. He prefers to give
    the proper French pronunciation to the words which he recognizes as
    French; and moreover as the possession of culture, or even of education,
    does not imply any knowledge of the history of English or of the
    principles which govern its growth, the men of culture are often
    inclined to pride themselves on this pedantic procedure.
</p>
<p>
    It is, perhaps, because the men of culture in the United States are
    fewer in proportion to the population that American usage is a little
    more encouraging than the British. Just as we Americans have kept alive
    not a few old words which have been allowed to drop out of the later
    vocabulary of the United Kingdom, so we have kept alive&mdash;at least to a
    certain extent&mdash;the power of complete assimilation. <i>Restaurant</i>, for
    example, is generally pronounced as though its second syllable rhymed
    with 'law', and its third with 'pant'. <i>Trait</i> is pronounced in
    accordance with its English spelling, and therefore very few Americans
    have ever discovered the pun in the title of Dr. Doran's book, 'Table
    Traits, and something on them'. I think that most Americans rhyme
    <i>distrait</i> to 'straight' and not to 'stray'. <i>Annexe</i> has become
    <i>annex</i>; <i>programme</i> has become <i>program</i>&mdash;although the longer form
    is still occasionally seen; and sometimes <i>coterie</i> and <i>reverie</i> are
    'cotery' and 'revery'&mdash;in accord with the principle which long ago
    simplified <i>phantasie</i> to <i>fantasy</i>. <i>Charade</i> like <i>marmalade</i> rhymes
    with <i>made</i>. <i>Brusk</i> seems to be supplanting <i>brusque</i> as <i>risky</i> is
    supplanting <i>risqué</i>. <i>Elite</i> is spelt without the accent; and it is
    frequently pronounced <i>ell-leet</i>. <i>Clôture</i> is rarely to be discovered
    in American newspapers; <i>closure</i> is not uncommon; but the term commonly
    employed is the purely English 'previous question'.
</p>
<p>
    In the final quarter of the nineteenth century an American adaptation of
    a French comic opera, 'La Mascotte', was for two or three seasons very
    popular. The heroine of its story was believed to have the gift of
    bringing luck. So it is that Americans now call any animal which has
    been adopted by a racing crew or by an athletic team (or even by a
    regiment) a <i>mascot</i>; and probably not one in ten thousand of those who
    use the word have any knowledge of its French origin, or any suspicion
    that it was transformed from the title of a musical play.
</p>
<p>
    I regret, however, to be forced to confess that I have lately been
    shocked by a piece of petty pedantry which seems to show that we
    Americans are falling from grace&mdash;at least so far as one word is
    concerned. Probably because many of our architects and decorators have
    studied in Paris there is a pernicious tendency to call a 'grill' a
    <i>grille</i>. And I have seen with my own eyes, painted on a door in an
    hotel <i>grille</i>-room; surely the ultimate abomination of verbal
    desolation!
</p>
<p>
    I may, however, record to our credit one righteous act&mdash;the perfect
    and satisfactory anglicizing of a Spanish word, whereby we have made
    'canyon' out of <i>cañon</i>. And I cannot forbear to adduce another word for
    a fish soup, <i>chowder</i>, which the early settlers derived from the French
    name of the pot in which it was cooked, <i>chaudière</i>.<a href="#note-1"><small>1</small></a>
</p>
<h3>
    IV
</h3>
<p>
    As the military vocabulary of English is testimony to the former
    leadership of the French in the art of war, so the vocabulary of fashion
    and of gastronomy is evidence of the cosmopolitan primacy of French
    millinery and French cookery. But most of the military terms were
    absorbed before the middle of the seventeenth century and were therefore
    assimilated, whereas the terms of the French dressmaker and of the
    French cook, chef, or <i>cordon bleu</i>, are being for ever multiplied in
    France and are very rarely being naturalized in English-speaking lands.
    So far as these two sets of words are concerned the case is probably
    hopeless, because, if for no other reason, they are more or less in the
    domain of the gentler sex and we all know that
</p>
<pre>
  'A woman, convinced against her will,
  Is of the same opinion still.'
</pre>
<p>
    The terms of the motor-car, however, and those of the airplane, are in
    the control of men; and there may be still a chance of bringing about a
    better state of affairs than now exists. While the war correspondents
    were actually in France, and while they were often forced to write at
    topmost speed, there was excuse for <i>avion</i> and <i>camion, vrille</i> and
    <i>escadrille</i>, and all the other French words which bespattered the
    columns of British and American, Canadian and Australian newspapers.
    I doubt if there was ever any necessity for <i>hangar</i>, the shed which
    sheltered the airplane or the airship. <i>Hangar</i> is simply the French
    word for 'shed', no more and no less; it does not indicate specifically
    a shed for a flying-machine; and as we already had 'shed' we need not
    take over <i>hangar</i>.
</p>
<p>
    When we turn from the gas-engine on wings to the gas-engine on wheels,
    we find a heterogeny of words in use which bear witness to the fact that
    the French were the first to develop the motor-car, and also to the
    earlier fact that they had long been renowned for their taste and their
    skill as coach-builders. As the terminology of the railway in England
    is derived in part from that of the earlier stage-coach&mdash;in the United
    States, I may interject, it was derived in part from that of the earlier
    river-steamboat&mdash;so the terminology of the motor-car in France was
    derived in part from that of the pleasure-carriage. So we have the
    <i>landaulet</i> and <i>limousine</i> to designate different types of body.
    I think <i>landaulet</i> had already acquired an English pronunciation; at
    least I infer this because I cannot now recall that I ever heard it fall
    from the lips of an English-speaking person with its original French
    pronunciation of the nasal <i>n</i>. And <i>limousine</i>, being without accent
    and without nasal <i>n</i> can be trusted to take care of itself.
</p>
<p>
    There are other technical terms of the motor-car industry which present
    more difficult problems. <i>Tonneau</i> is not troublesome, even if its
    spelling is awkward. There is <i>chauffeur</i> first of all; and I wish that
    it might generally acquire the local pronunciation it is said to have in
    Norfolk&mdash;<i>shover</i>. Then there is <i>chassis</i>. Is this the exact equivalent
    of 'running gear'? Is there any available substitute for the French
    word? And if <i>chassis</i> is to impose itself from sheer necessity what
    is to be done with it? Our forefathers boldly cut down <i>chaise</i> to
    'shay'&mdash;at least my forefathers did it in New England, long before
    Oliver Wendell Holmes commemorated their victory over the alien in the
    'Deacon's Masterpiece', more popularly known as the 'One Horse Shay'.
    And the men of old were even bolder when they curtailed <i>cabriolet</i> to
    'cab', just as their children have more recently and with equal courage
    shortened 'taximeter vehicle' to 'taxi', and 'automobile' itself to
    'auto'. Unfortunately it is not possible to cut the tail off <i>chassis</i>,
    or even to cut the head off, as the men of old did with 'wig',
    originally 'periwig', which was itself only a daring and summary
    anglicization of <i>peruke</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the fact that the drama has been more continuously alive in the
    literature of France than in that of any other country, and due also,
    it may be, to the associated fact that the French have been more loyally
    devoted to the theatre than any other people, the vocabulary of the
    English-speaking stage has probably more unassimilated French words than
    we can discover in the vocabulary of any of our other activities. We are
    none of us surprised when we find in our newspaper criticisms <i>artiste,
    ballet, conservatoire, comédienne, costumier, danseuse, début,
    dénoûment, diseuse, encore, ingénue, mise-en-scène, perruquier,
    pianiste, première, répertoire, revue, rôle, tragédienne</i>&mdash;the catalogue
    stretches out to the crack of doom.
</p>
<p>
    Long as the list is, the words on it demand discussion. As to <i>rôle</i> I
    need say nothing since it has been considered carefully in Tract No. 3;
    I may merely mention that it appeared in English at least as early as
    1606, so that it has had three centuries to make itself at home in our
    tongue. <i>Conservatoire</i> and <i>répertoire</i> have seemingly driven out the
    English words, which were long ago made out of them, 'conservatory'
    and 'repertory'. What is the accepted pronunciation of <i>ballet</i>? Is it
    <i>bal-lett</i> or <i>ballay</i> or <i>bally</i>? (If it is <i>bally</i>, it has a recently
    invented cockney homophone.) For <i>costumier</i> and <i>perruquier</i> I can see
    no excuse whatever; although I have observed them frequently on London
    play-bills, I am delighted to be able to say that they do not disgrace
    the New York programmes, which mention the 'costumer' and the
    'wigmaker'. 'Encore' was used by Steele in 1712; it was early made into
    an English verb; and yet I have heard the verb pronounced with the nasal
    <i>n</i> of the original French. Here is another instance of English taking
    over a French word and giving it a meaning not acceptable in Paris,
    where the playgoers do not <i>encore</i>, they <i>bis</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Why should we call a nondescript medley of dialogue and dance and
    song a <i>revue</i>, when <i>revue</i> in French is the exact equivalent of
    'review' in English? Why should we call an actress of comic characters
    a <i>comédienne</i> and an actress of tragic characters a <i>tragédienne</i>,
    when we do not call a comic actor a <i>comédien</i> or a tragic actor a
    <i>tragédien</i>? Possibly it is because 'comedian' and 'tragedian' seem
    to be too exclusively masculine&mdash;so that a want is felt for words to
    indicate a female tragedian and a female comedian. Probably it is for
    the same reason that a male dancer is not termed a <i>danseur</i> while
    a female dancer is termed a <i>danseuse</i>. Then there is <i>diseuse</i>,
    apparently reserved for the lady who recites verse, no name being
    needed apparently for the gentleman who recites verse&mdash;at least, I am
    reasonably certain that I have never seen <i>diseur</i> applied to any male
    reciter.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Mise-en-scène</i> is another of the French terms which has suffered a
    Channel-change. In Paris it means the arrangement of the stage-business,
    whereas in London and in New York it is employed rather to indicate the
    elaboration of the scenery and of the spectacular accessories. An even
    more extraordinary misadventure has befallen <i>pianiste</i>, in that it is
    sometimes used as if it was to be applied only to a female performer.
    And this blunder is of long standing; but I remember as lately as forty
    years ago seeing an American advertisement of Teresa Carreño which
    proclaimed her to be 'the greatest living <i>lady</i> pianiste'. I have
    also detected evidences of a startling belief of the illiterate that
    <i>artiste</i> is the feminine of 'artist'. Nevertheless I found recently in
    a volume caricaturing the chief performers of the London music-halls a
    foot-note which explained that these celebrities were therein entitled
    <i>artistes</i>&mdash;because 'an artist creates, an <i>artiste</i> performs'.
</p>
<p>
    Still to be analysed are <i>première</i> for 'first performance' or 'opening
    night' and <i>debut</i> for 'first appearance'; and I fear that it is beyond
    expectation that these alien words will speedily drop their alien
    accents and their alien pronunciations. The same must be said also of
    <i>dénoûment</i> and of <i>ingénue</i>&mdash;French words which really fill a gap in
    our vocabulary and which are none the less abhorrent to our speech
    habits. The most that is likely to happen is that they may shed their
    accents and more or less approximate an English pronunciation,
    <i>dee-noo-meant</i>, perhaps, and <i>inn-je-new</i>, an approximation which will
    be sternly resisted by the literate. I well remember one occasion when I
    overheard scorn poured upon a charming American actress who had happened
    to mention the date of her own <i>deb-you</i> in New York.
</p>
<h3>
    V
</h3>
<p>
    <i>Encore</i> and <i>mise-en-scène</i> are only two of a dozen or a score of
    French words not infrequently used in English and misused by being
    charged with meanings not strictly in accord with French usage. 'Levee'
    is one; the French say <i>lever</i>. <i>Nom de plume</i> is another; the French
    say <i>nom de guerre</i>. <i>Musicale</i> also is rarely, if ever, to be found
    in French, at least I believe it to be the custom in Paris to call
    an 'evening with music' a <i>soirée musicale</i>. If <i>musicale</i> is too
    serviceable to demand banishment, why should it not drop the <i>e</i> and
    become <i>musical</i>? When Theodore Roosevelt, always as exact as he was
    vigorous in his use of language, was President of the United States, the
    cards of invitation which went out from the White House bore 'musical'
    in one of their lower corners; so that the word, if not the King's
    English, is the President's English.
</p>
<p>
    To offset this I must record with regret that the late Clyde Fitch once
    wrote a one-act play about a manicurist, and as this operator on the
    finger-nails was a woman he entitled his playlet, the <i>Manicuriste</i>; and
    he did this in spite of the fact that, as a writer fairly familiar with
    French, he ought to have known the proper term&mdash;<i>manucure</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Then there is <i>double-entendre</i>, implying a secondary meaning of
    doubtful delicacy. Dryden used it in 1673, when it was apparently
    good French, although it has latterly been superseded in France by
    <i>double-entente</i>&mdash;which has not, however, the somewhat sinister
    suggestion we attach to <i>double-entendre</i>. I noted it in Trench's
    'Calderon' (in the 1880 reprint); and also in Thackeray; and both
    Calderon and Thackeray were competent French scholars.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps this is as good a place as any to consider <i>née</i>, put after the
    name of a married woman and before the family name of her father. The
    Germans have a corresponding usage, Frau Schmidt, <i>geboren</i> Braun. There
    is no doubt that <i>née</i> is convenient, and there is little doubt that
    it would be difficult to persuade the men of culture to surrender it
    or even to translate it. To the literate 'Mrs. Smith, born Brown',
    might seem discourteously abrupt. But the French word is awkward,
    nevertheless, since the illiterate often take it as meaning only
    'formerly', writing 'Mrs. Smith, <i>née</i> Mary Brown', which implies that
    this lady had been christened before she was born. And there is a tale
    of a profiteer's wife who wrote herself down as 'Mrs. John Smith, New
    York, <i>née</i> Chicago'.
</p>
<p>
    Yet the French themselves are not always scrupulous to follow <i>née</i> with
    only the family name of the lady. No less a scholar than Gaston Paris
    dedicated his <i>Poètes et Penseurs</i> to 'Madame James Darmesteter, <i>née</i>
    Mary Robinson'. Perhaps this is an instance of the modification of the
    strict meaning of a word by convention because of its enlarged
    usefulness when so modified.
</p>
<p>
    Gaston Paris must be allowed all the rights and privileges of a master
    of language; but his is a dangerous example for the unscholarly, who are
    congenitally careless and who are responsible for <i>soubriquet</i> instead
    of <i>sobriquet</i>, for <i>à l'outrance</i> instead of <i>à outrance</i>, and for <i>en
    déshabille</i> instead of <i>en déshabillé</i>. The late Mrs. Oliphant in her
    little book on Sheridan credited him with <i>gaieté du coeur</i>. It was
    long an American habit to term a railway station a <i>dépot</i> (totally
    anglicized in its pronunciation&mdash;<i>deep-oh)</i>; but <i>dépôt</i> is in French
    the name for a storehouse, and it is not&mdash;or not customarily&mdash;the name
    of a railway station. It was also a custom in American theatres to give
    the name of <i>parquette</i>-seats to the chairs which are known in England
    as 'stalls'; and in village theatres <i>parquette</i> was generally
    pronounced 'par-kay'.
</p>
<p>
    There are probably as many in Great Britain as in the United States
    who speak the French which is not spoken by the French themselves.
    Affectation and pretentiousness and the desire to show off are abundant
    in all countries. They manifest themselves even in Paris, where I once
    discovered on a bill of fare at the Grand Hotel <i>Irisch-stew à la
    française</i>. This may be companioned by a bill of fare on a Cunard
    steamer plying between Liverpool and New York, whereon I found myself
    authorized to order <i>tartletes</i> and <i>cutletes</i>. When I called the
    attention of a neighbour to these outlandish vocables, the affable
    steward bent forward to enlighten my ignorance. 'It's the French,
    sir,' he explained; '<i>tartlete</i> and <i>cutlete</i> is French.'
</p>
<p>
    That way danger lies; and when we are speaking or writing to those who
    have English as their mother-tongue there are obvious advantages in
    speaking and writing English, with no vain effort to capture Gallic
    graces. Readers of Mark Twain's <i>Tramp Abroad</i> will recall the scathing
    rebuke which the author administered to his agent, Harris, because a
    report which Harris had submitted was peppered, not only with French and
    German words, but also with savage plunder from Choctaw and Feejee and
    Eskimo. Harris explained that he intruded these hostile verbs and nouns
    to adorn his page, and justified himself by saying that 'they all do
    it. Everybody that writes elegantly'. Whereupon Mark Twain, whose own
    English was as pure as it was rich and flexible, promptly read Harris a
    needed lesson: 'A man who writes a book for the general public to read
    is not justified in disfiguring his pages with untranslated foreign
    expressions. It is an insolence toward the majority of the purchasers,
    for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying, "Get the translations
    made yourselves if you want it&mdash;this book is not written for the
    ignorant classes".... The writer would say that he uses the foreign
    language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in English.
    Very well, then, he writes his best things for the tenth man, and he
    ought to warn the other nine not to buy his book.'
</p>
<p>
    The result of these straight-forward and out-spoken remarks is set
    forth by Mark Twain himself: 'When the musing spider steps upon the
    red-hot shovel, he first exhibits a wild surprise, then he shrivels
    up. Similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil
    and unsuspecting agent. I can be dreadfully rough on a person when the
    mood takes me.'
</p>
<h3>

<p>
    This sermon might have been made even broader in its application. It is
    not always only the ignorant who are discommoded by a misguided reliance
    on foreign words as bestowers of elegance; it is often the man of
    culture, aware of the meaning of the alien vocable but none the less
    jarred by its obtrusion on an English page. The man of culture may have
    his attention disturbed even by a foreign word which has long been
    acclimatized in English, if it still retains its unfriendly appearance.
    I suppose that <i>savan</i> has established its citizenship in our
    vocabulary; it is, at least, domiciled in our dictionaries<a href="#note-2"><small>2</small></a>; but when
    I found it repeated by Frederic Myers, in <i>Science and a Future Life</i>,
    to avoid the use of 'scientist', the French word forced itself on me,
    and I found myself reviving a boyish memory of a passage in Abbott's
    <i>Life of Napoleon</i> dealing with Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt and
    narrating the attacks of the Mamelukes, when the order was given to
    form squares with '<i>savans</i> and asses in the center'.
</p>
<p>
    An otherwise fine passage of Ruskin's has always been spoilt for me by
    the wilful incursion of two French words, which seem to me to break the
    continuity of the sentence: 'A well-educated gentleman may not know many
    languages; may not be able to speak any but his own; may have read very
    few books. But whatever language he knows, he knows precisely; whatever
    word he pronounces, he pronounces rightly; above all, he is learned in
    the peerage of words; knows the words of true descent and ancient blood
    at a glance from words of modern <i>canaille</i>; remembers all their
    ancestry, their intermarriages, distantest relationships, and the extent
    to which they were admitted, and offices they hold, among the national
    <i>noblesse</i> of words, at any time and in any country.' Are not <i>canaille</i>
    and <i>noblesse</i> distracting? Do they not interrupt the flow? Do they not
    violate what Herbert Spencer aptly called the Principle of Economy of
    Attention, which he found to be the basis of all the rules of rhetoric?
</p>
<p>
    Since I have made one quotation from Ruskin, I am emboldened to make two
    from Spencer, well known as his essay on 'Style' ought to be:&mdash;'A reader
    or listener has at each moment but a limited amount of mental power
    available. To recognize and interpret the symbols presented to him,
    requires part of his power; to arrange and combine the images suggested
    requires a further part; and only that part which remains can be used
    for realizing the thought conveyed. Hence, the more time and attention
    it takes to receive and understand each sentence, the less time and
    attention can be given to the contained idea; and the less vividly will
    that idea be conceived.'&mdash;'Carrying out the metaphor that language is
    the vehicle of thought, there seems reason to think that in all cases
    the friction and inertia of the vehicle deduct from its efficiency; and
    that in composition, the chief, if not the sole thing to be done, is to
    reduce this friction and inertia to the smallest possible amount.'
</p>
<p>
    <i>Savan</i> and <i>canaille</i> and <i>noblesse</i> may be English words; but they
    have not that appearance. They have not rooted themselves in English
    earth as <i>war</i> has, for instance, and <i>cab</i> and <i>wig</i>. To me, for one,
    they increase the friction and the inertia; and yet, of course, the
    words themselves are not strange to me; they seem to me merely out of
    place and in the way. I can easily understand why Myers and Ruskin
    wanted them, even needed them. It was because they carried a meaning not
    easily borne by more obvious and more hackneyed nouns. 'The words of our
    mother tongue', said Lowell in his presidential address to the Modern
    Language Association of America, 'have been worn smooth by so often
    rubbing against our lips and our minds, while the alien word has all the
    subtle emphasis and beauty of some new-minted coin of ancient Syracuse.
    In our critical estimates we should be on our guard against its charm.'
</p>
<p>
    Since I have summoned myself as a witness I take the stand once more to
    confess that Alan Seeger's lofty lyric, 'I have a rendezvous with Death'
    has a diminished appeal because of the foreign connotations of
    'rendezvous'. The French noun was adopted into English more than three
    centuries ago; and it was used as a verb nearly three centuries ago; it
    does not interfere with the current of sympathy when I find it in the
    prose of Scott and of Mark Twain. Nevertheless, it appears to me
    unfortunate in Seeger's noble poem, where it forces me to taste its
    foreign flavour.
</p>
<p>
    Another French word, <i>bouquet</i>, is indisputably English; and yet when I
    find it in Walt Whitman's heartfelt lament for Lincoln, 'O Captain, my
    Captain', I cannot but feel it to be a blemish:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
  'For you <i>bouquets</i> and ribbon'd wreaths&mdash;for you the shore's a-crowding,
   For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning.'
</pre>
<p>
    It may be hypercriticism on my part, but <i>bouquet</i> strikes me as sadly
    infelicitous; and a large part of its infelicity is due to its having
    kept its French spelling and its French pronunciation. It is not in
    keeping; it diverts the flow of feeling; it is almost indecorous&mdash;much
    as a quotation from Voltaire in the original might be indecorous in a
    funeral address delivered by an Anglican bishop in a cathedral.
</p>
<h3>
    VII
</h3>
<p>
    There are several questions which writers and speakers who give thought
    to their expressions will do well to ask themselves when they are
    tempted to employ a French word or indeed a word from any alien tongue.
    The first is the simplest: Is the foreign word really needed? For
    example, there is no benefit in borrowing <i>impasse</i> when there exists
    already in English its exact equivalent, 'blind-alley', which carries
    the meaning more effectively even to the small percentage of readers or
    listeners who are familiar with French. Nor is there any gain in
    <i>résumé</i> when 'summary' and 'synopsis' and 'abstract' are all available.
</p>
<p>
    The second question is perhaps not quite so simple: Is the French word
    one which English has already accepted and made its own? We do not
    really need <i>questionnaire</i>, since we have 'interrogatory', but if we
    want it we can make shift with 'questionary'; and for <i>concessionnaire</i>
    we can put 'concessionary'. To balance 'employer' there is 'employee',
    better by far than <i>employé</i>, which insists on a French pronunciation.
    Matthew Arnold and Lowell, always apt and exact in their use of their
    own tongue, were careful to prefer the English 'technic' to the French
    <i>technique</i>, which is not in harmony with the adjectives 'technical' and
    <i>polytechnic</i>. So 'clinic' seems at last to have vanquished its French
    father <i>clinique</i>, as 'fillet' has superseded <i>filet</i>; and now that
    'valet' has become a verb it has taken on an English pronunciation.
</p>
<p>
    Then there is <i>littérateur</i>. If a synonym for 'man of letters' is
    demanded why not find it in 'literator', which Lockhart did not
    hesitate to employ in the <i>Life of Scott</i>. It is pleasant to believe
    that <i>communard</i>, which was prevalent fifty years ago after the burning
    of the Tuileries, has been succeeded by 'communist' and that its
    twin-brother <i>dynamitard</i> is now rarely seen and even more rarely heard.
    Perhaps some of the credit may be due to Stevenson, who entitled his
    tale the <i>Dynamiter</i> and appended a foot-note declaring that 'any
    writard who writes <i>dynamitard</i> shall find in me a never-resting
    fightard'.
</p>
<p>
    The third question may call for a little more consideration: Has the
    foreign word been employed so often that it has ceased to be foreign
    even though it has not been satisfactorily anglicized in spelling and
    pronunciation? In the <i>Jungle Book</i> Mr. Kipling introduces an official
    who is in charge of the 'reboisement' of India; and in view of the
    author's scrupulosity in dealing with professional vocabularies we may
    assume that this word is a recognized technical term, equivalent to the
    older word 'afforestation'. What is at once noteworthy and praiseworthy
    is that in Mr. Kipling's page it does not appear in italics. And in
    Mr. Pearsall Smith's book on the English language one admiring reader
    was pleased to find 'débris' also without italics, although with the
    retention of the French accent. Perhaps the time is not far distant
    when the best writers will cease to stigmatize a captured word with
    the italics which are a badge of servitude and which proclaim that it
    has not yet been enfranchised into our language.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth question is the most perplexing: If the formerly foreign
    word has been taken over and if it can therefore be utilized without
    hesitancy, can it be made to form its plural in accord with the customs
    of English. Here those who seek to make the English language truly
    English and to keep it truly pure, will meet with sturdy resistance.
    It will not be easy to persuade the literate, the men of culture, to
    renounce the <i>x</i> at the end of <i>beaux</i> and <i>bureaux</i> and to spell these
    plurals 'beaus' and 'bureaus'. And yet no one doubts that 'beau' and
    'bureau' have both won the right to be regarded as having attained an
    honourable standing in our language.
</p>
<h3>
    VIII
</h3>
<p>
    'De Quincey once said that authors are a dangerous class for any
    language'&mdash;so Professor Krapp has reminded us in his book on <i>Modern
    English</i>, and he has explained that De Quincey meant 'that the literary
    habit of mind is likely to prove dangerous for a language ... because it
    so often leads a speaker or writer to distrust natural and unconscious
    habit, even when it is right, and to put in its stead some conscious
    theory of literary propriety. Such a tendency, however, is directly
    opposed to the true feeling for idiomatic English. It destroys the sense
    of security, the assurance of perfect congruity between thought and
    expression, which the unliterary and unacademic speaker and writer often
    has, and which, with both literary and unliterary, is the basis for all
    expressive use of language'.
</p>
<p>
    And since I have borrowed the quotation from Professor Krapp I shall
    bring this rambling paper to an end by borrowing another, from the
    <i>Toxophilus</i> of Roger Ascham (1545).
</p>
<p>
    'He that will wryte well in any tongue must folowe this council of
    Aristotle, to speake as the common people do, to think as wise men do.
    Many English writers have not done so, but using straunge wordes as
    latin, french, and Italian, do make all things darke and harde. Once I
    communed with a man whiche reasoned the englyshe tongue to be enryched
    and encreased thereby, sayinge&mdash;Who wyll not prayse that feaste where a

<h2>
    NOTES
</h2>
<p>
    The word <b>laches</b>, which is not noticed in the above paper, is one
    of a list of words sent to us by a correspondent who suggests that
    it is the business of our society to direct the public as to their
    pronunciation. Like other examples given by Mr. Matthews, <i>laches</i> seems
    to be at present in an uncertain condition; and as it is used only by
    lawyers they will be able to decide its future. What seems clear about
    it is that the two contending pronunciations are homophones, one with
    <i>latches</i> the other with <i>lashes</i>. The A having been Englished its
    closing T seems natural; and <i>latches</i> (from <i>lachesse</i>) is thus an
    exact parallel with <i>riches</i> (from <i>richesse</i>). But there seems no
    propriety in the SS being changed to Z. The pronunciation <i>látchess</i>
    would save it from its awkward and absurd homophone <i>latches</i>, and would
    be in order with <i>prowess, largess, noblesse</i>, &amp;c. Moreover, since
    <i>laches</i> is used only as the name of a quality (= negligence) and never
    (like <i>riches</i>), as a plural, to connote special acts of negligence, the
    pronunciation <i>latchess</i> would be correct as well as convenient; and the
    word would be better spelt with double S: <i>lachess</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Of the word <b>levee</b> the <i>O.E.D.</i> says, 'All our verse quotations
    place the stress on the first syllable. In England this is the court
    pronunciation, and prevails in educated use. The pronunciation' with the
    accent on the second syllable 'which is given by Walker, is occasionally
    heard in Great Britain, and appears to be generally preferred in the
    U.S.', but the dictionary does not quote Burns
</p>
<pre>
  'Guid-mornin' to your Majesty!
    May Heav'n augment your blisses,
  On ev'ry new birthday ye see,
    A humble poet wishes!
  My bardship here, at your levee,
    On sic a day as this is,
  Is sure an uncouth sight to see,
    Amang thae birthday dresses
               Sae fine this day.'
</pre>
<p>
    So that it would seem that the Scotch and American pronunciation of this
    word is more thoroughly Englished than our own: and the prejudice which
    opposes straightforward common-sense solutions, however desirable they
    may be, is brought home to us by the fact that almost all Englishmen
    would be equally shocked by the notion either of spelling this word as
    they pronounce it, <i>levay</i>, or of pronouncing it, like Burns, as they
    spell it, <i>levee</i>.

<h2>
    ENGLISH WORDS IN FRENCH
</h2>
<p>
    It would be instructive if we could give a parallel account of what the
    French do when they adopt an English word into their language. <i>Le
    Dictionnaire des Anglicismes</i>, lately published by Delagrave, has two
    hundred pages, and is much praised by a reviewer in the <i>Mercure de
    France</i>, Feb. 15, p. 246: but it does not give the current French
    pronunciations of the English words. The reviewer writes: 'Ce qui me
    gène bien davantage, c'est que M. Bonnaffé supprime, partout, avec
    rigueur, la façon française de prononcer le mot anglais. Était-il
    superflu de dire comment nous articulons <i>shampooing</i>? Nous n'avons, je
    crois, qu'une forme orale pour <i>boy</i>, petit domestique, parce qu'il est
    dû à l'oreille; mais nous sommes partagés quant à <i>boy-scout</i>, qui est
    arrivé par tracts et par journaux. L'anglais donne un mot <i>high-life</i>,
    le français en fait cinq: <i>haylayf, aïlaïf, ichlif, ijlif, iglif</i>.'
    p. 247. It would seem from <i>high-life</i> that English words in French
    sometimes look as strange as French words do when represented in
    make-shift English phonetics. On p. 228 of the same <i>Mercure</i> there is
    notice of 'un petit manuel de conversation' in which 'Toutes les nuances
    de la "phonetic pronunciation" sont notées, à l'usage des Américains
    désireux de se faire comprendre en français. Cette notation (says the
    reviewer) m'a tellement amusé que je ne puis résister au plaisir

    'citation'. Vecktor should be Veektor? and H looks like a misprint

<h2>
    ON THE DIALECTAL WORDS IN EDMUND BLUNDEN'S POEMS<a href="#note-3"><small>3</small></a>
</h2>
<p>
    In the original prospectus of the S.P.E., reprinted in Tract I, and
    again in III, p. 9, one of the objects of the Society is stated to be
    the 'enrichment and what is called regeneration of the language from the
    picturesque vocabularies of local vernaculars'. Since a young poet, Mr.
    Edmund Blunden, has lately published a volume in which this particular
    element of dialectal and obsolescent words is very prominent, it will be
    suitable to our general purpose to consider it as a practical experiment
    and examine the results. The poetic diction and high standard of his
    best work give sufficient importance to this procedure; and though he
    may seem to be somewhat extravagant in his predilection for unusual
    terms, yet his poetry cannot be imagined without them, and the strength
    and beauty of the effects must be estimated in his successes and not in
    his failures.
</p>
<p>
    In the following remarks no appreciation of the poetry will be
    attempted: our undertaking is merely to tabulate the 'new' words,
    and examine their fitness for their employment. The bracketed numbers
    following the quotations give the page of the book where they occur.
    The initials <i>O.E.D.</i> and <i>E.D.D.</i> stand for the <i>Oxford English
    Dictionary</i> and the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> (Wright).
</p>
<pre>
  1.    'And churning owls and goistering daws'. (1)
</pre>
<p>
    Here <i>churning</i> is a mistake; we are sorry to begin with an
    animadversion, but the word should be <i>churring</i>. <b>Churr</b> is an
    echo-word, and though there may be examples of echo-words which have
    been bettered by losing all trace of their simple spontaneous origin,
    this is not one. It is like <i>burr, purr,</i> and <i>whirr</i>; and these words
    are best spelt with double R and the R should be trilled. The absurdity
    of not trilling this final R is seen very plainly in <i>burr</i>, because
    that word's definition is 'a rough sounding of the letter R.' This is
    not represented by the pronunciation b&#601;:. What that 'southern
    English' pronunciation does indicate is the vulgarity and inconvenience
    of its degradations. <i>Burr</i> occurs in these poems:
</p>
<pre>
  'There the live dimness burrs with droning glees'.             (23)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Burr</b> is, moreover, a bad homophone and cannot neglect possible
    distinctions: the Oxford Dictionary has eight entries of substantives
    under <i>burr.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Our author also uses <i>whirr</i>:
</p>
<pre>
  'And the bleak garrets' crevices
  Like whirring distaffs utter dread',                           (26)
</pre>
<p>
    and again of the noise of wind in ivy, on p. 54, and
</p>
<pre>
  'The damp gust makes the ivy whir',                            (48)
</pre>
<p>
    <i>whir</i> rhyming here with <i>executioner</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Since <i>churring</i> (in the first quotation) would automatically preserve
    its essential trill, the intruder <i>churning</i> is the more obnoxious; and
    unless the R can be trilled it would seem better for poets to use only
    the inflected forms of these words, and prefer <i>churreth</i> to <i>churrs</i>.
</p>
<p>
    If <i>churn</i> is anywhere dialectal for <i>churr</i>, it must have come from the
    common mistake of substituting a familiar for an unknown word: and this
    is the worst way of making homophones.
</p>
<pre>
  2.    'goistering daws'.
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Goister</b> or <b>gauster</b> is a common dialect verb; the latter
    form seems the more common and is recognized in the Oxford Dictionary,
    where it is defined 'to behave in a noisy boisterous fashion ... in some
    localities to laugh noisily'. If jackdaws are to appropriate a word to
    describe their behaviour, no word could be better than <i>goistering</i>, and
    we prefer <i>goister</i> to <i>gauster</i>. Its likeness to <i>boisterous</i> will
    assist it, and we guess that it will be accepted. In the little glossary
    at the end of the book <i>goistering</i> is explained as <i>guffawing</i>. That
    word is not so descriptive of the jackdaw, since it suggests 'coarse
    bursts of laughter', and the coarseness is absent from the fussy
    vulgarity and mere needless jabber of the daw.
</p>
<pre>
  3.    'A dor flew by with crackling cry'.                       (7)
</pre>
<p>
    This to the ear is
</p>
<pre>
  'A daw flew by with crackling cry';
</pre>
<p>
    and though our poet's glossary tells us that dor = dor-hawk or nightjar,
    it really is not so. A dor is a beetle so called from its making a
    <i>dorring</i> noise, and the name, like <i>churr</i> and <i>burr</i>, is better with
    its double R and trill. <i>Dor-hawk</i> may be a name for the <i>nightjar</i>, but
    properly <i>dorr</i> is not; and if it were, it would be forbidden by <i>daw</i>
    so long as it neglected its trill. Note also the misfortune that four
    lines below we read
</p>
<pre>
  'The pigeons flaunted round his door',
</pre>
<p>
    where the full correct pronunciation of <i>door</i> (d[&#596;&#601;) will
    not quite protect it. The whole line quoted from
    p. 7 is obscure, because a nightjar would never be recognized by the
    description of a bird that utters a crackling cry when flying. That
    it then makes a sound different from its distinctive whirring note is
    recorded. T.A. Coward writes 'when on the wing it has a soft call co-ic,
    and a sharper and repeated alarm quik, quik, quik.' It is doubtful
    whether <i>crackling</i> can be accepted.
</p>
<pre>
  4.    'The grumping miller picked his way'.                     (8)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Grumping</b> is a good word, which appears from the dictionaries to
    be a common-speech term that is picking its way into literature.
</p>
<pre>
  5.    'The golden nobs and pippens swell'.                     (12)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>nob</b> is <i>knob</i>. Golden-nob is 'a variety of apple'; see <i>E.D.D.</i>:
    and as a special name, which the passage implies, it should be hyphened.
</p>
<pre>
  6.                'where the pollards frown,
        Notched, dumb, surly images of pain'.                    (13)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Notched.</b> This word well describes the appearance of old pollard
    willows after they have been cropped; but its full propriety may escape
    notice. A very early use of the verb <i>to notch</i> was to cut or crop the
    hair roughly, and <i>notched</i> was so used. The Oxford Dictionary quotes
    Lamb, 'a notched and cropt scrivener'. Then <i>pollard</i> itself is from
    <i>poll</i>, and means an animal that has lost its horns as well as a tree
    that has been 'pollarded'.
</p>
<pre>
  7.    'In elver-peopled crevices'.                             (19)
</pre>
<p>
    We are grateful for <b>elver</b>. This form has carefully differentiated
    itself from <i>eel-fare</i>, which means the passage of the young eels up the
    rivers, and has come to mean the <i>eel-fry</i> themselves.
</p>
<pre>
  8.    'For Sussex cries from primrose lags and breaks'.        (22)
</pre>
<p>
    <i>E.D.D.</i>, among many meanings of <b>lag</b>, explains this as a Sussex
    and Somerset term for 'a long marshy meadow usually by the side of a
    stream'. Since the word seems as if it might be used for anything
    somewhere, we cannot question its title to these meadows, but we doubt
    its power to retain possession, except in some favoured locality.
</p>
<pre>
  9.    'And chancing lights on willowy waterbreaks'.            (22)
</pre>
<p>
    We have to guess what a <i>waterbreak</i> is, having found no other example
    of the word.
</p>
<pre>
  10.    'Of hobby-horses with their starting eyes'.             (23)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Hobby-horse</b> as a local or rustic name for dragon-fly can have no
    right to general acceptance.
</p>
<pre>
  11.    'Stolchy ploughlands hid in grief.'                     (24)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Stolchy</b> is so good a word that it does not need a dictionary.
    Wright gives only the verb <i>stolch</i> 'to tread down, trample, to walk in
    the dirt'. The adjective is therefore primarily applicable to wet land
    that has become sodden and miry by being <i>poached</i> by cattle, and then
    to any ground in a similar condition. Since <i>poach</i> is a somewhat
    confused homophone, its adjective <i>poachy</i> has no chance against
    <i>stolchy</i>.
</p>
<pre>
  12.    'I whirry through the dark'.                            (24)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Whirry</b> is another word that explains itself, and perhaps the more
    readily for its confusion (in this sense) with <i>worry</i>, see <i>E.D.D.</i>
    where it is given as adjective and verb, the latter used by Scott in
    'Midlothian'. 'Her and the gude-man will be whirrying through the
    blue lift on a broom-shank.' In the <i>Century Dictionary</i>, with its
    pronunciation hwér'i, it is described as dialectal form of <i>whirr</i> or
    of <i>hurry</i>, to fly rapidly with noise, also transitive to hurry.
</p>
<pre>
  13.    'No hedger brished nor scythesman swung'.               (25)
</pre>
<p>
    and
</p>
<pre>
         'The morning hedger with his brishing-hook'.            (62)
</pre>
<p>
    These two lines explain the word <b>brish</b>. <i>O.E.D.</i> gives <i>brish</i> as
    dialectal of <i>brush</i>, and so <i>E.D.D.</i> has the verb <i>to brush</i> as dialect
    for trimming a tree or hedge. Brush is a difficult homophone, and it
    would be useful to have one of its derivative meanings separated off
    as <i>brish</i>.
</p>
<pre>
  14.    'A hizzing dragonfly that daps
          Above his mudded pond'.                                (28)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Hizzing</b> is an old word now neglected. Shakespeare has
</p>
<pre>
         'To have a thousand with red burning spits
          Come hizzing in upon 'em'.&mdash;<i>Lear</i>, III. vi. 17.
</pre>
<p>
    and there are other quotations in <i>O.E.D.</i>
</p>
<p>
    15. <b>Dap</b> is used again, 'the dapping moth'. (45.) This word is
    well known to fishermen and fowlers, meaning 'to dip lightly and
    suddenly into water' but is uncommon in literature.
</p>
<pre>
  16.    'The glinzy ice grows thicker through'.                 (28)
</pre>
<p>
    Author's glossary explains <b>glinzy</b> as slippery. <i>E.D.D.</i> gives
    this word as <i>glincey</i> and derives from French <i>glincer</i> as <i>glisser</i>,
    to slide or glide. <i>Glinzy</i> and <i>glincey</i> carry unavoidable suggestion
    of <i>glint</i>. Compare the words in No. 19. <i>Glissery</i> would be convincing.
</p>
<pre>
  17.    'The green east hagged with prowling storm'.            (30)
</pre>
<p>
    In <i>O.E.D.</i> <b>hagged</b> is given as monopolized by the sense of
    'bewitched', or of 'lean and gaunt', related to haggard. This does not
    suit. The intention is probably an independent use of the p.p. of the
    transitive verb 'to hag'; defined as 'to torment or terrify as a hag,
    to trouble as the nightmare'.
</p>
<pre>
  18.    'where with the browsing thaive'.                       (31)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Thaive</b> is a two-year-old ewe. Wright gives <i>theave</i> or <i>theeve</i>
    as the commoner forms, and in the Paston letters it is <i>theyve</i>, which
    perhaps confirms <i>thaive</i>, rhymed here with 'rave'. Certainly it is most
    advisable to avoid <i>thieves</i>, the plural of thief, although <i>O.E.D.</i>
    allows this pronunciation and indeed puts it first of the alternatives.
</p>
<pre>
  19.    'On the pathway side ... the glintering flint'.         (32)
</pre>
<p>
    <i>O.E.D</i>. gives <b>glinter</b> as a 'rare' word. We have <i>glinting,
    glistening, glittering</i>, and <i>glistering</i>, and Scotch <i>glisting</i>.
</p>
<pre>
  20.    'The wind tangs through the shattered pane'.            (34)
</pre>
<p>
    Echo-words, like ting-tang, ding-dong, &amp;c., must have their liberty; but
    of <b>tang</b> it should be noted that, though the verb may raise no
    inconvenience, yet the substantive has a very old and well-established
    use in the sense of a projecting point or barb (especially of metal), or
    sting, and that this demands respect and recognition. It is something
    less than prong, and is the proper word for the metal point that fixes
    the strap of a buckle. The homophonic ambiguity is notorious in
    Shakespeare's
</p>
<pre>
         'She had a tongue with a tang',
</pre>
<p>
    where, as the <i>O.E.D.</i> suggests, the double sense of sting and ring were
    perhaps intended.
</p>
<pre>
  21.    'The grutching pixies hedge me round'.                  (37)
</pre>
<p>
    <i>Grudge</i> and <b>grutch</b> are the same word. The use of the obsolete
    form would therefore be fanciful if there were no difference in the
    sense; but there is a useful distinction: because grudge has entirely
    lost its original sense of murmuring, making complaint, and is confined
    to the consciousness and feeling of discontent, whereas <i>grutch</i> is
    recognized as carrying the old meaning of grumble. Thus Stevenson as
    quoted in <i>O.E.D.</i>, 'The rest is grunting and grutching'. It is a very
    useful word to restore, but it may, perhaps, at this particular time
    find <i>grouse</i> rather strongly entrenched.
</p>
<pre>
  22.    'Where the channering insect channels'.                 (46)
</pre>
<p>
    This is, of course, our old friend
</p>
<pre>
          The cock doth craw, the day doth daw,
          The channerin' worm doth chide',
</pre>
<p>
    and it looks like an attempt to define what is there meant, viz. that
    the worm made a <b>channering</b> noise in burrowing through the wood.
    The notion is perhaps admissible, though we cannot believe the sound to
    be audible.
</p>
<pre>
  23.    'The lispering aspens'.                                 (53)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Lispering.</b> We should be grateful for this word. <i>O.E.D.</i> quotes
    it from Clare's poems.
</p>
<pre>
  24.    'Of shallows with the shealings chalky white'.          (64)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Sheal</b> is a homophone, 1. a shepherd's hut or shanty; 2. a peascod
    or seed-shell. Of the first, <i>shiel</i> and <i>shieling</i> are common forms;
    the second is dialectal; <i>E.D.D.</i> gives <b>shealing</b> as the husk of
    seeds. If this be the meaning in our quotation, the appearance described
    is unrecognized by the present annotator.
</p>
<pre>
  25.                                 'Dull streams
         Flow flagging in the undescribed deep fourms
         Of creatures born the first of all, long dead'.         (67)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Fourm</b>, explained as a 'hare's lurking place', commonly called
    <i>form</i>, widely used and understood because the lair has the shape or
    form of the animal that lay in it. But perhaps it was originally only
    the animal's seat or form, as we use the word in schools. <i>Form</i> has so
    many derivative senses that it would be an advantage to have this one
    thus differentiated both in spelling and sound.
</p>
<pre>
  26.    'Toadstools twired and hued fantastically'.             (68)
</pre>
<p>
    Though the word <b>twired</b> is not explained in Mr. Blunden's glossary
    and the meaning is not evident from the context, we guess that he is
    using it here of shape, in the sense of 'contorted', which would range
    with the quotation from Burton (given in some dictionaries) 'No sooner
    doth a young man see his sweetheart coming, but he ... slickes his
    haire, twires his beard [&amp;c.]'. Here <i>twires</i>, as latest edition of
    <i>O.E.D.</i> suggests, may be a misprint for <i>twirls</i>. Older dictionaries
    give wrong and misleading definitions of this word; and a spurious
    <i>twire</i>, to sing, was inferred from a misreading 'twierethe' for
    'twitereth' in Chaucer's <i>Boethius</i>, III m. 2. Modern authorities only
    allow <i>twire</i>, to peep, as in Shakespeare's 28th Sonnet,
</p>
<pre>
         'When sparkling stars twire not, thou gildst the even'
</pre>
<p>
    (whence some had foolishly supposed that <i>twire</i> meant twinkle) and in
    Ben Jonson, <i>Sad Shepherd</i>, II. 1, 'Which maids will twire at, 'tween
    their fingers'. The verb is still in dialectal use: <i>E.D.D.</i> explains it
    'to gaze wistfully or beseechingly'.
</p>
<pre>
  27.                   'The tiny frogs
             Go yerking'.                                        (69)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Yerk.</b> The intrans. verb is to kick as a horse. The trans. verb is
    quoted from Massinger, Herrick, and Burns, who has 'My fancy yerkit up
    sublime': i.e. roused, lashed.
</p>
<pre>
  28.    'There seems no heart in wood or wide'.                  (8)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Wide</b> as a subst. is hardly recognized. Tennyson is quoted, 'The
    waste wide of that abyss', but as <i>waste</i> is a recognized substantive
    the authority is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
    In the above examples we have taken such words as best answered our
    purpose, neglecting many which have almost equal claims. The richness of
    the vocabulary in unusual words and in words carrying unusual meanings
    forbids complete examination; as will be seen by a rough classification
    of some of those which we have passed over.
</p>
<p>
    To begin with the words which our author uses well, we will quote as an
    example all the passages in which <b>writhe</b> occurs. The transitive
    verb which is perhaps in danger of neglect is very valuable, and it is
    well employed. These passages will also fully exhibit the general
    quality of Mr. Blunden's diction.
</p>
<pre>
    'But no one loves the aguish mist
     That writhes its way at eventide
     Along the copse's waterside'.                                (3)

  'But now the sower's hand is writhed
   In livid death '.                                             (25)

  'To-morrow's brindled shouting storms with flood
   The purblind hollows with a leaden rain
   And flat the gleaning-fields to choking mud
   And writhe the groaning woods with bursts of pain'.           (42)

  'The lispering aspens and the scarfed brook-grasses
   With wakened melancholy writhe the air'.                      (53)
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Dimpling</b> is well and poetically used in
</p>
<pre>
  'While the woodlark's dimpling rings
   In the dim air climb'.                                        (21)
</pre>
<p>
    and also <i>quag</i> (verb) (2), <i>seething</i> (3), <i>channelled</i> (9), <i>bunch</i>
    (11), <i>jungled</i> (11), <i>rout</i> (verb) (12), <i>fluster</i> (13), <i>byre</i> (13),
    <i>plash</i> (shallow water) (19), <i>tantalise</i> (neut. v.) (36), <i>hutched</i>
    (43), <i>flounce</i> (44), <i>rootle</i> (45), <i>shore</i> (verb) (59). <i>Lair</i> (verb)
    (43) does not seem a useful word.
</p>
<p>
    Next, words somewhat obscurely or fancifully used are <i>starving</i> (1),
    <i>stark</i> (10), <i>honeycomb</i> (15), <i>cobbled</i> (of pattens) (16), <i>lanterned</i>
    (24), <i>well</i> (49), <i>bergomask</i> (for village country dances?) (25),
    <i>belvedere</i> (of the spider's watch tower) (26).
</p>
<p>
    While the following seem to us incorrectly used: <i>mumbling</i> (23) used of
    wings; the word is confined to the mouth whether as a manner of eating
    or of speaking: <i>crunch</i> (28) where the frosts crunch the grass: whereas
    they only make it crunchable. <i>maligns</i> (54) used as a neuter verb
    without precedent, <i>chinked</i> (58) of light passing through a chink:
    and note the homophone chink, used of sound. And then the line
</p>
<pre>
  'The blackthorns clung with heapen sloes'                      (55)
</pre>
<p>
    contains two reprehensible liberties, because <i>clung</i> in its
    original proper sense means congealed or shrivelled; to <i>cling</i> was an
    intransitive verb meaning to adhere together: its modern use is to stick
    fast [to something]&mdash;and secondly, <i>heapen</i> is not a grammatical form;
    the p.p. is <i>heaped</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Again, in the line
</p>
<pre>
  'He well may come with baits and trolls',                      (11)
</pre>
<p>
    we do not know whether <i>trolls</i> has something to do with pike-fishing,
    or merely means the reel on the rod. In that sense it lacks
    authority(?), moreover it is a homophone, used by our poet in
</p>
<pre>
  'And trolls and pixies unbeknown'.                             (18)
</pre>
<p>
    Finally, there are a good many English country names for common plants,
    for example, Esau's-hands, Rabbits'-meat, Bee's balsams, Pepper-gourds,
    Brandy-flowers, Flannel-weed, and Shepherd's rose; and some of these are
    excellent, and we very much wish that more of our good English
    plant-names could be distinctively attached.
</p>
<p>
    We will not open the discussion here, except to say that the casual
    employment of local names is of no service because so many of these
    names are common to so many different plants. Our author's
    <b>Rabbits'-meat</b>, for instance, is applied to <i>Anthriscus
    sylvestris</i>, <i>Heracleum Spondylium</i>, <i>Oxalis Acetosella</i> and <i>Lamium
    purpureum</i>; all of which may be suitable rabbits' food. But each
    one of these plants has also a very wide choice of other names: thus
    <i>Anthriscus sylvestris</i>, besides being <i>Rabbits-meat</i> may be familiarly
    introduced as Dill, Keck, Ha-ho, or Bun, and by some score of other
    names showing it to be disputed for by the ass, cow, dog, pig and even
    by the devil himself to make his oatmeal.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Heracleum Spondylium</i>, alias Old Rot or Lumper-scrump, provides
    provender for cow, pig, swine, and hog, and also material for Bear's
    breeches.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Oxalis Acetosella</i> is even richer in pet-names. After Rabbits'-meat,
    sheep-sorrel, cuckoo-spice, we find Hallelujah! Lady's cakes, and God
    Almighty's bread-and-cheese. These are selected from fifty names.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Lamium purpureum</i> is not so polyonymous. With Tormentil, Archangel,
    and various forms of Dead-nettle, we find only Badman's Posies and
    Rabbits'-meat.
</p>
<p>
    The worst perplexity is that well-known names, which one would think
    were securely appropriated, are often common property. Our authority for
    the above details&mdash;the <i>Dictionary of English Plant-names</i>, by James
    Britten and Robert Holland&mdash;tells us that <i>Orchis mascula</i>, the 'male
    orchis', is also called Cowslip, Crowsfoot, Ragwort, and Cuckoo-flower.
    This plant, however, seems to have suggested to the rustic mind the most
    varied fancies, similitudes of all kinds from 'Aaron's beard' to
    'kettle-pad'.

<p>
    The Committee of the S.P.E. invite the membership of all those who are
    genuinely interested in the objects of the Society and willing to assist
    in its work. The Secretary will be glad to receive donations of any
    amount, great or small, which will be duly acknowledged and credited in
    the Society's banking account.
</p>
<p>
    Members who wish to have the tracts of the Society forwarded to them as
    they are issued, should ensure this by sending a subscription of 10<i>s</i>.
    to the Secretary, who will then supply them for the current year of
    their subscription. The four tracts published in the last year were thus
    sent to a number of subscribers; and it would greatly assist the Society
    if all these would renew their subscriptions, and if others would
    subscribe for our forthcoming publications in the same manner. All
    donations and subscriptions should be sent to the Hon. Secretary,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
